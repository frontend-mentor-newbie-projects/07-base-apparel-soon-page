## Overview

### The challenge

The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0) was to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - The `input` field is empty.
    - The email address is not formatted correctly.
